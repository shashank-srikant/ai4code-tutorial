# Dataset
The dataset is from the defect detection task in [CodeXGLUE](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeXGLUE/tree/main/Code-Code/Defect-detection).

The readme on the task's page provides details on how to setup the dataset. 
You do not have to carry out any of those steps.
These steps are implemented in the tutorial notebook.
